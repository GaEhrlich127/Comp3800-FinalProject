Voting is a crucial part of many democratic systems, but traditional First Past the Post systems can leave many people unsatisfied. Ranked Choice Voting allows voters to rank candidates in their order of preference, and have their votes applied correspondingly.

## Features
1. Candidate Ranking and Voting
2. Adding New Candidates
    * Included to mimic the ability to Write-In Candidates as you can in the USA's elections.
3. Unique Identifier Uploading
    * Intended to be representative of a fingerprint, this allows in person investigations of potential fraud.
4. Live Results
    * Anyone can see the results of the election at that exact moment, until official results are processed.
